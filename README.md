This weather app was designed by me to allow a user to look up the weather in any city or townin the world. By simply using the search bar in the top left, users can look up their desired location to see the current weather, forecast for the day, and forecast for the next 2 days. I developed several key skills while creating this app:

 - how to use a third party API and pull datasets from it, in this case, I learned how to fetch a weather API and pull it into my own code

 - how to process the data recieved from an API, using JSON.

 - demonstrated real-world application of Promises, using async functions and await statements to help handle asynchronous code

 - learned to create error systems using Promises and 'catch', to ensure that users are entering valid values into the search bar

 - how to delete API requests when the application needs to fetch a new one

 - took basic pieces of data from the API and converted it all the way into an actual User Interface that the user can interact with
